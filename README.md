Social media is a dynamic tool that allows people to connect with each other, but it has become a portal for researchers to explore society on a large scale basis. This has implications ranging from gauging societal interest to monitoring situations around the world. Resources such as Twitter have proven to be important in developing a better understanding of how people interact online. In this lab, I used Twitter to try to start to understand the political situation surrounding Eritrea and Ethiopia. These traditional foes have recently become friends after a shift in power. This shift has presented a number of interesting questions in the understanding of how the situation is viewed. For my lab, I set out to investigate users and hashtags on Twitter with an end objective of measuring active Twitter accounts with large audiences and popular hashtags being used alongside specific keywords.

This is a personal project to build out a reusable twitter analysis for different applications ranging from geographic to public health. With the Twitter Network files, a follower network is built to indentify major social network influencers in certain social realms. (Originally built to identify social influencers during the Eritrean friendship declaration with Ethiopia) The Tweet Pull folder has scripts to pull Twitter data based on key word, build out key word search terms based on most used words, and collect/store Tweets in real-time in a PostgreSQL database. 



At the moment, I'm currently working on a sentiment classifier (positive/negative) using Tensorflow/Keras which is still a work in progress.
